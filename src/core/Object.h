/**
 * @brief The Object class
 * The Object class is the base class of all objects in this lib.
 * It's an abstract class so it must be subclassed.
 * Object have parent and children. They live in a tree.
 * The tree should help developers to prevent memory leaks since
 * deleting the parents will delete the children.
 *
 * To destroy an object call Object::destroy() which will emit requestDestroy to the parent.
 * The parent will run onRequestChildDestroy which will:
 * - emit destroying signal
 * - remove the child from the list of children
 * The destructor will be automatically invoked when the shared_ptr count reaches zero.
